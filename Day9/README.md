Subject: Clarification on Teamup Bug Bounty Program Status

Hi Teamup Security / Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m interested in contributing to your Bug Bounty Program. Before proceeding with any security research or testing, I wanted to confirm whether the program is currently *active* and whether there have been any recent changes in the scope, rules, or exclusions since the last update on April 4, 2024 (from your website).

Could you please confirm:

1. That the Bug Bounty Program is still running.
2. If there have been any updates to the guidelines, scope, or contact process since the April 2024 page.
3. Whether there are any parts of your service or domains that are explicitly excluded (beyond what is listed) that researchers should avoid.

Thank you for maintaining the security of Teamup, and I appreciate your guidance before I begin.

Best regards,
[Your Name / Handle]
[Optional: Your affiliation / researcher profile]
